#### This is the code page for Group 09 of the Fall 2015 Freshman Engineering design class.

The goal of our project is to create a presence detection alarm clock. The hardware involves an Arduino, strain gauges, an RTC (real time clock), a speaker, and a display. This program is an alarm clock that receives it's time information from the RTC, and sensor input from the strain gauge. The overall intent is to have the signal from the strain gauge shut off the alarm.

Enjoy!
